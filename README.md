Squarespace Project Readme Boilerplate
=======
> Document your Squarespace projects with this README boilerplate.



## Project Overview
Up your documentation game, impress your clients and look sharp when working with other developers. This repo aims to help you improve your project documentation by showing you some best practice for documenting Squarespace projects.

### What's In This Repo?
This repo is an example of an entire top-level dev tools repo plus a bare bones Squarespace template, with example files. [project-title](/project-title) would be your root project directory, ideally managed with Github. This project is meant to show some good practices for keeping your doc game tight.

### Highlights

* Structured READMEs that thoroughly explain everything going on.
* Readable Squarespace template comments to help your devs understand and learn Squarespace while they work.
* Readable configuration file comments.

## Usage
Use this repo any way you want! Take one idea, or many. The easiest way to get setup is by using your text editor's project-wide Find & Replace command and replacing our placeholders with your own. Eventually I'll try to automate this a little more. This will give you a better understanding of how everything ties together. So after cloning this repo, run a Find & Replace on the following:

* PROJECT_TITLE - Replace with your Project's Title
* PROJECT_URL - Replace with your Project's production URL.
* GITHUB_USERNAME - Replace with the primary Github account you work in.
* PROJECT_TITLE_SLUG - Replace with the URL slug version of your Project Title.
* AUTHOR_NAME - The Author/Company name you want in your Squarespace template.conf.
